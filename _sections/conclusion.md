This study demonstrates how tactile awareness recruits a hierarchical mixture of sensory, salience, and attention-related cortical areas to support bodily awareness. Collectively our results illustrate hierarchical processing of surprising tactile stimuli and suggest a critical role for the anterior insula in coordinating global cortical processing and possibly bodily self-awareness. If the AIC does coordinate dynamic interactions between these disparate neural processes via precision modulation, such a mechanism would be crucial for establishing the “global workspace” argued to be necessary for consciousness ([Dehaene et al. 2014](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2013.12.005)). Embodied predictive coding may thus provide a framework for understanding how particular predictive codes integrating internal states and external sensory inputs give rise to self-awareness. Understanding how the insula coordinates this complex interaction, and how various sensory channels are integrated and precision-weighted by contextual factors ([Feldman and Friston 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00215)) is likely to yield important future insights into consciousness, emotion, and disruptions thereof. In particular future research may find that hyper- or hypo- connectivity of prefrontal to insula connections plays a critical role in common disorders of bodily awareness, e.g. Ekbom’s syndrome (chronic tactile hallucination) and phantom limb phenomenon.
