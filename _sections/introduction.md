The sense of self and experience of emotion are known to rely on highly multimodal interactions between interoceptive, somatosensory and proprioceptive signals, as well as prior beliefs about the causes of these sensations ([Gallagher 2005](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/0199271941.001.0001); [Brown et al. 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10339-013-0571-3)). Recently, predictive coding has been used to explain how these interactions produce embodied and emotional awareness ([Apps and Tsakiris 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.01.029); [Seth 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2013.09.007)). One key prediction is that the anterior insula cortex (AIC) acts as a comparator between incoming bodily sensations and the brain's prior beliefs. In this paper we test this hypothesis in the somatosensory domain, using dynamic causal modelling (DCM).

Somatosensation underlies the conscious body-image that underpins body-ownership and action agency (Serino and Haggard 2010) and has recently been shown to rely on hierarchical Bayesian inferences ([Auksztulewicz et al. 2012](https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.3974-11.2012); [Ostwald et al. 2012](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.04.050)). The AIC is richly interconnected with the posterior insula and somatosensory cortex ([Cerliani et al. 2012](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.21338); [Chang et al. 2012](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhs065)), and anticipates the sensory and affective consequences of touch ([Lovero et al. 2009](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.12.070)). Probabilistic hierarchical inferences involving the AIC and cingulate cortex are thought to support interoception ([Seth et al. 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00395)), pain analgesia ([Büchel et al. 2014](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.02.042)), and somatosensation ([Ostwald et al. 2012](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.04.050)). The AIC in particular is thought to integrate these modalities to create a multimodal self-model ([Apps and Tsakiris 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.01.029); [Gu et al. 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cne.23368)) that underpins dynamic cognitive control ([Ullsperger et al. 2010](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00429-010-0261-1)) and embodied self-awareness ([Gallagher 2005](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/0199271941.001.0001)). Further evidence comes from findings linking AIC activations to body-state prediction errors, for example in the case of gustatory conflict ([O’Doherty et al. 2002](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0896-6273\(02\)00603-7)), unexpected painful stimulation ([Seymour et al. 2005](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn1527); [Keltner et al. 2006](https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.4463-05.2006)), or during false heart rate-feedback ([Critchley et al. 2004](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn1176)). Little is currently known about how the AIC communicates tactile prediction errors throughout the cortical hierarchy. Delineating the impact of somatosensory changes on insula responses is thus critical for understanding embodied perception.

To address these issues, we adapted a roving somatosensory oddball task (RSOT) for use during fMRI scanning. Sensory oddball or deviance responses in the brain have been strongly linked to prediction error minimization, and the RSOT has previously been shown to elicit prediction errors in somatosensory and cingulate cortex. An advantage of the RSOT over standard oddball designs is the ability to control for stimulus-specific effects, as all stimuli (e.g. high and low intensity) serves as both deviant and standard. We thus used DCM for fMRI to investigate the causal impact of unexpected somatosensory stimuli on effective neural connectivity between the AIC and other structures. We reasoned that if the AIC acts as a bodily comparator, deviance should increase both ingoing connections from sensory and thalamic areas and outgoing connections to prefrontal and cingulate cortex. We further expected to observe an overall pattern of increased forward-driving connectivity throughout a hierarchy of subcortical and cortical regions in response to deviancy, consistent with a hierarchical predictive coding account of somatosensory awareness. Finally, if top-down expectations underlie bodily awareness ([Seth et al. 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00395); [Apps and Tsakiris 2013](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.01.029)), we predicted that participants with the strongest modulation of backwards connections from the prefrontal cortex to the AIC would rate somatosensory deviants as easier to detect.
