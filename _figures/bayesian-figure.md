title: "Post-hoc Bayesian model selection (panels A and B), winning model (panel C), and mean coupling parameter plots (panel D)"
description: "(A) Top left panel depicts the range of log-posterior probability among all models examined. The top middle panel (B) shows the posterior probability for all tested models. Model 255 had the highest probability of 0.79. Model 128 was the next most probable with a posterior probability of 0.06, resulting in a Bayes factor of 13.17 for the full versus reduced model, corresponding to positive evidence that the full model was the best explanation for the measured data within the tested model space. (C) Depiction of the winning full model (Model 255, far right peak in Figure 3B), gray circles indicate modulation by the Deviant > Standard contrast. (D) Bar plot depicting mean posterior parameter estimates for all modulatory (DCM.Ep.B) parameters across subjects, indicating the strength in Hertz with which each connection was modulated by deviant > standard stimuli. Error bars depict standard error. Modulations of inhibitory self-connections are shown at the right hand side of the graph."
