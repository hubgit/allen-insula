title: "Schematic depicting experimental setup and example stimulus train"
description: "Participants received mild somatosensory electrical stimulation (50 μs pulse) at twice sensory threshold on median nerve of the left forearm. Subjective intensity was manipulated by switching between single pulse (bottom-row) and double pulse (top-row) trials. Double pulses were identical to the single pulses, with a 100 ms interstimulus interval. Repetitions varied randomly from 3-7 before switching to the alternate stimulus type, with repetition counts sampled from a random normal distribution. The first stimulus of each train corresponded to a deviant (D), whereas the following repetitions were defined as standards (S1, S2, …, S6). For our fMRI analysis, only the deviant trials and the third standard in each train were modelled (see Methods for more details)."
