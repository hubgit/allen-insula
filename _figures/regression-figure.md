title: "Robust Regression analysis with self-reported difficulty for detecting stimulus changes predicting the strength of deviance-driven modulation of effective connectivity"
description: "Left panel A, participants with enhanced modulation of the backwards MFG to AIC connection by surprising touch stimuli reported easier discrimination of stimulus changes. Data points depict individual participants; points shaded gray indicate those receiving down weights > 2 SD from the mean weighting (leverage points). These results suggest that top-down prefrontal to AIC connectivity underlies awareness of unexpected tactile changes, as predicted by embodied predictive coding. Right panel B depicts results of robust regressions (Tukeyâ€™s biweight) over 20 intrinsic connection modulation parameters each predicting subjective difficulty, <i>P<sub>FDR</sub></i> threshold < 0.05."
