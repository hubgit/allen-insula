title: "Full model and results of one-sample t-tests over estimated modulatory parameters"
description: "Red arrows depict results of one-sample t-tests over all 25 modulation parameters (inhibitory self- connections indicated by circular arrow around each region label). A general caudal to rostral flow increased effectivity connectivity in response to tactile deviants can be observed from thalamus (TH), and primary somatosensory cortex (S1), to anterior insula (AIC) and mid- cingulate (MCC), before reaching prefrontal cortex (middle frontal gyrus, MFG). In contrast to this feed-forward flow of modulatory influences, the AIC shows significant increases in both ‘forwards’ connections to cingulate and prefrontal cortex and ‘backwards’ connections with S1, indicative of error comparison. Interestingly, TH, AIC, and S1 self-connections are strongly disinhibited by tactile deviants. All p-values false discovery rate corrected for multiple comparisons, <i>P<sub>FDR</sub></i> < 0.05."
