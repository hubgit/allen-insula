title: "Significant BOLD activations for the deviant > standard contrast"
description: "From left to right, images are centred on the peak voxel extracted for each region modelled in the DCM; dorso- posterior thalamus (panels A and B), anterior insula (C), middle cingulate (D), primary somatosensory cortex (E), and the middle frontal gyrus extending into DLPFC (F). Statistical parametric maps, family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons P<sub>FWE</sub> < 0.05, shown on average of 152 1mm-resolution anatomical scans, normalized to MNI space. Corresponding in- plane MNI coordinate are shown below each image."
